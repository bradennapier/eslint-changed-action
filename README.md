## Configuration

You provide configuration properties within your workflow by using the `with` property.  See the `Simple Workflow Example` for an example of providing your github-token.  

> `array` types are expected to be comma-separated values

## Examples

### Simple Workflow Example

Below is a basic example which should get you going.  You can view the action.yml to see what other properties are available for customization.

```yml
name: "my-workflow"
on: [pull_request]

jobs:
  eslint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - uses: bradennapier/eslint-plus-action@v2
```

### Environment Variables

There may be times that you need to provide a `NPM_TOKEN` so that the action can install your private repos.  You do this by adding the secret to your repo `Settings -> Secrets` then providing it as an environment variable to the action:

```yml
jobs:
  eslint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - uses: bradennapier/eslint-plus-action@v2
      env:
        NPM_TOKEN: ${{secrets.NPM_TOKEN}}
```

### Providing Parameters

```yml
jobs:
  eslint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - uses: bradennapier/eslint-plus-action@v2
      env:
        NPM_TOKEN: ${{secrets.NPM_TOKEN}}
      with: 
        issueSummaryType: full
        reportIgnoredFiles: true
```

## Credits

This action was adapted from other actions which didn't quite work for me but were close.  So special thanks to them for helping me get here.
